#Equation Solver

This is a small tool that will solve a system of equations with three variables

##Getting Started

These instructions will get you started on how to use the tool

###Installation Instructions

1. Clone this project using git bash or download the zip file and extract it to a location of your choosing
1. Navigate to the 'Install' folder 
1. Run the file 'EquationSolverInstaller.msi. This will install the tool on your PC
1. When the setup is complete, navigate to the 'Sample" folder and copy the file 'input.txt' into the location where the    tool was installed.


##Runninng the tool

Currently the tool is configured to solve a system of equations of three variables only. Flexibility in the number of equations that the tool can solve simulataneously is currently under development.

To solve a system of equations with three variables, follow the following steps:

1. Open the 'input.txt' file and insert the system of equalions you want to solve. Please follow the following guielines when inserting the equations:
	*One equation per line
	*no spaces, * or any other characters except +,.,-,=,numbers and alphabets
1. Save the file and close it
1. Run the executable 'EquationSolver.exe' 
1. When the cmd closes, open the file 'output.txt' to see the reuslts

##Future Features

* Flexible number of variables in the system of equations
* Flexible input methods for equations
* Display step by step solution
* User friendly GUI for the tool
